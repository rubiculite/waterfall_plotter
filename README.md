# Waterfall Plotter

Here I am building a d3.js (Version 4) based Waterfall Plotter widget. Waterfall plots are used in Radio Astronomy for studying various objects, such as, Pulsars, Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs), Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), etc.

# Work in Progress

## Testing

Works OK in Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. It renders in Firefox, but the X-Hairs do not function.

## Features
* Fast Data Load
* Linear Intensity Scaling
* Mouse-over X-Hairs
* X-Hairs On/Off
* RFI On/Off

## TA-DO List
* Thumb Nail
* Log Intensity Scaling
* Intensity Cut-Off
* Intensity Filter Window
* X-Hairs arrow key bindings
* X-Hairs touch screen implementation
* Zoom (Requires code restructuring... almost there!)
* Pan 
* Separate Out the Random Data Generator from the Widget Code.
